# Vault Engineer Bot

## Problem Statement

Managing and unsealing a HashiCorp Vault can be a complex task, especially when coordinating the process among multiple users who possess different unseal keys. Furthermore, the rekey process adds another layer of complexity requiring careful coordination and security.

## Purpose

The Vault Engineer Bot is designed to simplify and automate the process of managing HashiCorp Vault's unseal and rekey operations. It allows authorized users to easily provide their unseal keys, initiate rekey processes, and receive new keys, all through a convenient Telegram bot interface.

## Use Case

- **Automated Vault Unseal**: Coordinate unseal key submissions from multiple users and ensure the Vault is correctly unsealed.
- **Rekey Management**: Initiate and manage the rekey process, ensuring that new keys are distributed securely and efficiently among authorized users.
- **Status Updates**: Provide real-time updates on the Vault's status and notify users of any issues during the unseal or rekey processes.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The bot is initialized with environment variables specifying the Vault's required unseal keys, total keys, and authorized Telegram users.
2. **Commands**:
   - `/start`: Welcome message to the bot.
   - `/vault_status`: Get the current status of the Vault.
   - `/unseal "key"`: Provide an unseal key. The bot collects the required number of keys and attempts to unseal the Vault.
   - `/rekey_init`: Initiate the rekey process, enabling the `/rekey_init_keys` command.
   - `/rekey_init_keys "key"`: Provide a rekey key during the rekey process.
   - `/rekey_cancel`: Cancel the ongoing rekey process.
   - `/help`: Display available commands.
3. **Unseal Process**: Users provide their unseal keys through the bot. Once the required number of keys is collected, the bot attempts to unseal the Vault and verifies the unseal status.
4. **Rekey Process**: Users can initiate the rekey process, after which they provide their rekey keys. The bot collects these keys, completes the rekey process, and distributes the new keys to the users.
5. **Verification and Updates**: The bot continuously verifies the Vault's status and provides updates to users, ensuring transparency and security throughout the process.

## Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure the following environment variables are set:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The token provided by BotFather for your Telegram bot.
   - `VAULT_REQUIRED_KEYS`: The number of keys required to unseal the Vault.
   - `VAULT_TOTAL_KEYS`: The total number of keys.
   - `TELEGRAM_USERS`: Comma-separated list of authorized Telegram usernames.
   - `VAULT_HOST`: The URL of your Vault instance.
2. **Run the Bot**: Deploy the bot by running the Go application. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the environment variables are correctly set.
3. **Interaction**: Authorized users can interact with the bot via Telegram to manage the Vault's unseal and rekey processes.
